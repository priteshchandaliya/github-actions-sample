Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a GitHub Actions project and enable the checkov (Prisma Cloud) scan for misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, compliance and secret.


This will create a workflow:

- Provision a EC2 instance via terraform 
- Scan the terraform template (IaC) for any of the misconfigurations, vulnerabilities
- Scan a vulnerable app (code included)


Steps:

1. Fork this repo
2. Add the AWS key and secret under Actions > secret
3. Add the checkov (prisma cloud) access key and secret under Actions > secret
4. Make a change to the readme file and commit the changes and push it
5. Monitor the Actions tab on the Github UI
6. It should show you step by step all the results
